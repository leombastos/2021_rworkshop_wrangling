# Data wrangling and iteration in R Workshop  

Hey there!  

This is a public GitHub repository to share the files needed for the **Kansas State University 2021 AGSA R Workshop - Data wrangling and iteration**, taught on November 16th by [@leombastos](https://github.com/leombastos).

The workshop is divided into 2 main sessions (1h/session):  
- Data wrangling using popular functions like
    - `clean_names()`  
    - `filter()`  
    - `mutate()`  
    - `case_when()`  
    - `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`  
    - `group_by()` and `summarise()`  
    - `select()`  
    - the piper operator `%>%`  
- Iteration using the `map()` and `map2()` functions  

## **Interested in "attending" the workshop?**  

1. Download this repository (click on the green "Code" button above and select "*Download ZIP*")  

2. Unzip the repository, launch the RStudio project (by clicking on the "*2021_rworkshop_wrangling.Rproj*" file).  

3. On RStudio, go to the "*Files*" tab (lower right), click on folder "*markdown*", and open file 
    - "*session1_partial.Rmd*" for data wrangling  
    - "*session2_partial.Rmd*" for iteration   

4. You can code along with us by watching the following YouTube videos (links will be posted later in November):  
   - [wrangling]()  
   - [iteration]()
